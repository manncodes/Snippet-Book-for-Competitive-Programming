# Snippet-Book-for-Competitive-Programming (VSCode)
3 keystrokes away from most of the code required for Competitive Programming! (Except Geometry library, it hard ;-; )

### Prerequisites:
No conflicts in following macros should occur, and you may use your template or one provided in file **`template.cpp.code-snippets`**
```cpp
#define rep(i, a, b) for(int i = a; i < (b); ++i)
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
#define sz(x) (int)(x).size()
typedef long long ll;
typedef pair<int, int> pii;
typedef vector<int> vi;
```
Edit the above to make changes in the containers.

### Snippets Included:
- My template.cpp snippet which includes custom on create placeholder variables.
- Permutation to Integer
- Multinomial
- Fenwick Tree
- Fenwick Tree 2D
- Hash Maps
- Lazy Segment Tree
- Line Container
- Matrix 
- Order Statistic Tree
- RMQ (Ranged Minimum Queries)
- Segment Tree
- SubMatrix
- Treap
- Union Find
- 2SAT Graph
- Bellman Ford Algorithm
- Biconnnected Components
- Binary Lifting
- Directed MST(Minimal Spanning Tree)
- LCA(Leat Common Ancestor)
- DFS Matching
- Topological Sort
- Strongly Connected Components
- Continued Fractions
- Euclids Algorithm
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Fractional Binary Search
- Modular Inverse
- Mod Log
- Mod Mult
- Mod Pow
- Mod Sum
- Mod Arithmetic
- Fast fourier Transform
- Hill Climbing
- Determinant (Brute force)
- KMP Pattern Matching
- Suffix Array
- Suffix Tree
- Fast Modulo
- Graph

### Usage: 

1) Copy these two files in the path : 

      **`C:\Users\<YourUserName>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets\`** folder. 

2) Reload VSCode 

3) To Check if the .json files are parsed, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to open Command Pallete and and type Snippet Configure, and if configured properly they will be shown in the list of suggested commands. 

4) To use template code snippet it can be done anywhere just type cpp and the snippet suggestion would popup, if you want to use the DSA Code, you have to make a .cpp file to use them in it :)
